Suppose you want to maintain the highest and lowest temperatures for every day of the year. What kind of data structure would you use? Describe the alternatives and list their pros and cons. 

__Answer:__

I think that for this case we need a data structure _Year_, which consists from Months, and _Month_ consist 
from Days. Each _Day_ has fields with highest and lowest temperatures.

We also can use nested arrays to represent this data structure but OOP approach is more better and easy to understand.
