If a car dealer’s service department wants a program to keep track of customer appointments, which data structure should they choose, an array or a list? If the number of appointments the service department accepts is ﬁxed on any given day, which data structure is appropriate? What are the criteria you use to decide which data structure to use? Explain.

__Answer:__

The only criteria to choose _list_ or _array_ is knowledge about size of needed data structure.
If size is already known and it's fixed we should use an _array_. Otherwise if size is unknown or/and not fixed we should
us a _list_. It relies to the idea of _list_.
